# Survival_Prediction_EDA
 Analyzed the Titanic dataset to predict passenger survival based on provided information. Cleaned redundant data using NumPy and Pandas. Implemented decision tree and Naive Bayes classifier models from scratch. Utilized Scikit-learn to employ a random forest classifier with hyperparameter tuning. Identified factors influencing survival rates.
